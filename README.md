# 🧠 CPP Modules – 42 School

Welcome to the **C++ Modules** project, part of the 42 Common Core curriculum. This repository contains the exercises and solutions for the ten C++ modules (from 00 to 09), designed to introduce students to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using the C++98 standard.

## 📚 About the Project

> "C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or 'C with Classes'."
> — *Wikipedia*

The goal of these modules is to help you transition from procedural programming in C to object-oriented programming in C++. C++ was chosen as the OOP introduction language due to its close relationship with C, even though it introduces a significant number of new features and concepts.

Modern C++ has evolved far beyond the C++98 standard, which is used here to keep the learning curve gentle and the focus clear. If you're aiming to become a proficient C++ developer, continuing your journey beyond this module is highly encouraged!
